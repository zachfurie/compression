# Learning compression in Go

I am learning compression algorithms and implementing them in Go. Suggestions are appreciated  : )

**Status:**
* Huffman: *complete*, but currently does not save tree between runs, so can only encode and decode in same run
* Context Tree Weighting: *incomplete*

**Sources:**
* CTW: https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.14.352&rep=rep1&type=pdf


**TODO:**
* Get main.go file to be able to compare compression algs
* Code a compression algorithm in Rust
